Quarantine started March 13th 2020; I remember it very clearly. I was in gym class playing badminton when the announcements came on, “Attention all students, North Allegheny School District will be closed for 2 weeks due to concerns about the Corona Virus.” My whole class cheered, me included. Although we didn’t know it was going to last for months. Today as I’m typing this it is May 29th, 2020. I don’t think anyone expected to be in quarantine for this long. I have been handling it okay, I never really got out of the house that much to begin with so not much has changed for me besides not being able to see people at school or hang out with people. I think that’s the hardest part about it is losing that social aspect. School has been a lot more confusing and harder for a lot of my friends and sometimes myself included. Even though it’s hard I appreciate everything that NA has done to try to make this the best year they can for us. They delivered signs for us to put outside our house “Congratulations Class of 2020 Graduate.” I guess that’s where all the prom money went lol. They also had a parade for all the seniors driving in a line of cars through our neighborhoods, it was really sweet and I’m happy with the things NA has done to try to help raise our spirits. Pennsylvania is currently a yellow state or at least Pittsburgh is. Things seem like they’re getting better but it’s all just a waiting game. Even though this isn’t the senior year I wanted, it’s definitely a great life experience and a fun story to tell my kids.
